# Responsive social media template with PHP/MYSQL

This is a social media using php/mysql.

I have tried to challange my self in this project and not used any of my previous codes or classes.
This is a pure work of only 5 hours to challange my ability to code php/mysql without any framework.

I believe the code has many rooms to improvement however the lack of timing was another challange which was
quite a good excercise.
